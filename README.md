# Taiko DAO contracts

This reposity contains the codebase of the Taiko DAO, along with its 3 plugins and helper contracts. 

The DAO contract is an [Aragon DAO](https://github.com/aragon/osx), on which an **Optimistic Token Voting plugin** has the permission to execute proposals. Proposals on this plugin can only be created by two distinct multisig plugins, belonging to Taiko's Security Council.

![Taiko DAO Overview](./img/overview.png)

The Security Council operates a standard multisig plugin and an emergency variant. The standard Multisig is designed to be the place where DAO proposals start their journey. Any signer can submit a new proposal to the Security Council. After a certain approval ratio is reached, the proposal will be forwarded to the Optimistic voting plugin, where the community will need to ratify it.

The Emergency Multisig, is meant to only be used under exceptional circumstances, i.e. when a critical vulnerability needs to be addressed immediately. Any signer can submit proposals as well, but these proposals will need to be approved by a super majority before they can be executed directly on the DAO. 

Another key difference is that the Emergency Multisig is designed such in a way that the human readable description and the actions are private to the signers until the proposal is finally executed.

## Optimistic Token Voting plugin

This plugin is an adapted version of Aragon's [Optimistic Token Voting plugin](https://github.com/aragon/optimistic-token-voting-plugin). 

Only addresses that have been granted `PROPOSER_PERMISSION_ID` on the plugin can create proposals. These adresses belong to the two multisig's governed by the Security Council. 

Proposals can only be executed when the veto threshold hasn't been reached after a given period of time.

The governance settings need to be defined when the plugin is installed but the DAO can update them at any time.

### Permissions

- Only proposers can create proposals on the plugin
- The plugin can execute actions on the DAO
- The DAO can update the plugin settings
- The DAO can upgrade the plugin

## Multisig (standard flow)

It allows the Security Council members to create and approve proposals. After a certain minimum of approvals is met, proposals can be relayed to the [Optimistic Token Voting plugin](#optimistic-token-voting-plugin) only.

The ability to relay proposals to the [Optimistic Token Voting plugin](#optimistic-token-voting-plugin) is restricted by a [permission condition](src/conditions/StandardProposalCondition.sol), which ensures that a minimum veto period is defined as part of the parameters.

### Permissions

- Only members can create proposals
- Only members can approve
- The plugin can only create proposals on the [Optimistic Token Voting plugin](#optimistic-token-voting-plugin) provided that the `duration` is equal or greater than the minimum defined
- The DAO can update the plugin settings

## Emergency Multisig

Like before, this plugin allows Security Council members to create and approve proposals. If a super majority approves, proposals can be relayed to the [Optimistic Token Voting plugin](#optimistic-token-voting-plugin) with a delay period of potentially 0. This is, being executed immediately. 

The address list of this plugin is taken from the standard Multisig plugin. Any changes on the former will effect both plugin instances. 

There are two key differences with the standard Multisig:
1. The proposal's metadata and the actions to execute are encrypted, only the Security Council members have the means to decrypt them
2. When the proposal is executed, the metadata and the actions become publicly visible on the [Optimistic Token Voting plugin](#optimistic-token-voting-plugin). There is an integrity check to prevent any changes to the originally approved content.

### Permissions

The Emergency Multisig settings are the same as for the standard Multisig. 

- Only members can create proposals
- Only members can approve
- The plugin can only create proposals on the [Optimistic Token Voting plugin](#optimistic-token-voting-plugin) provided that the `duration` is equal or greater than the minimum defined
- The DAO can update the plugin settings

## Public Key Registry

This is a helper contract that allows Security Council members to register the public key of their deterministic ephemeral wallet. The available public keys will be used to encrypt the proposal metadata and actions. Refer to the UI repository for the encryption details.

NOTE: A published public key cannot be changed once published. 

- A wallet can only generate one derived key pair. 
- Public key registration is an automated process. No human error should be possible.
- Altering an encryption key is a strange edge case of which the rest of signers should be aware of. 

## Delegation Wall

This is a very simple contract that serves the purpose of storing the IPFS URI's pointing to the delegation profile posted by all candidates. Profiles can be updated by the owner and read by everyone.

## Installing plugins to the DAO

### Installing the initial set of plugins on the DAO

This is taken care by the [TaikoDAOFactory](src/factory/TaikoDaoFactory.sol) contract. It is invoked by [scripts/Deploy.s.sol](script/Deploy.s.sol) and it creates a holistic, immutable DAO deployment, given some settings. To create a new DAO with new settings, a new factory needs to be deployed. 

### Installing plugins on the existing DAO

Plugin changes need a proposal to be passed when the DAO already exists.

There are two steps, a permissionless **preparation** and a privileged **application**. 

1. Calling `pluginSetupProcessor.prepareInstallation()`
   - A new plugin instance is deployed with the desired settings
   - The call stores the request of a set of permissions
2. A proposal is passed to make the DAO call `applyInstallation()` on the [PluginSetupProcessor](https://devs.aragon.org/docs/osx/how-it-works/framework/plugin-management/plugin-setup/)
   - This applies the requested permissions and the plugin becomes installed

See [OptimisticTokenVotingPluginSetup](src/setup/OptimisticTokenVotingPluginSetup.sol).

[Learn more about plugin setup's](https://devs.aragon.org/docs/osx/how-it-works/framework/plugin-management/plugin-setup/) and [preparing installations](https://devs.aragon.org/docs/sdk/examples/client/prepare-installation).

## OSx protocol overview

OSx [DAO's](https://github.com/aragon/osx/blob/develop/packages/contracts/src/core/dao/DAO.sol) are designed to hold all the assets and rights by themselves. On the other hand, plugins are custom opt-in pieces of logic that can implement any type of governance. They are meant to eventually make the DAO execute a certain set of actions.

The whole ecosystem is governed by the DAO's permission database, which is used to restrict actions to only the role holding the appropriate permission.

### How permissions work

An Aragon DAO is a set of permissions that are used to define who can do what, and where.

A permission looks like:

- An address `who` holds `MY_PERMISSION_ID` on a target contract `where`

Brand new DAO's are deployed with a `ROOT_PERMISSION` assigned to its creator, but the DAO will typically deployed by the DAO factory, which will install all the requested plugins and drop the ROOT permission after the set up is done.

Managing permissions is made via two functions that are called on the DAO:

```solidity
function grant(address _where, address _who, bytes32 _permissionId);

function revoke(address _where, address _who, bytes32 _permissionId);
```

### Permission Conditions

For the cases where an unrestricted permission is not derisable, a [Permission Condition](https://devs.aragon.org/osx/how-it-works/core/permissions/conditions) can be used.

Conditional permissions look like this:

- An address `who` holds `MY_PERMISSION_ID` on a target contract `where`, only `when` the condition contract approves it

Conditional permissions are granted like this:

```solidity
function grantWithCondition(
  address _where,
  address _who,
  bytes32 _permissionId,
  IPermissionCondition _condition
);
```

See the condition contract boilerplate. It provides the plumbing to easily restrict what the different multisig plugins can propose on the OptimisticVotingPlugin.

[Learn more about OSx permissions](https://devs.aragon.org/osx/how-it-works/core/permissions/#permissions)

### Permissions being used

Below are all the permissions that a [PluginSetup](#plugin-setup-contracts) contract may want to request:

- `EXECUTE_PERMISSION` is required to make the DAO `execute` a set of actions
  - Only governance plugins should have this permission
- `ROOT_PERMISSION` is required to make the DAO `grant` or `revoke` permissions
  - The DAO needs to be ROOT on itself (it is by default)
  - Nobody else should be ROOT on the DAO
- `UPGRADE_PLUGIN_PERMISSION` is required for an address to be able to upgrade a plugin to a newer version published by the developer
  - Typically called by the DAO via proposal
  - Optionally granted to an additional address for convenience
- `PROPOSER_PERMISSION` is required to be able to create optimistic proposals on the governance plugin
- `UPDATE_MULTISIG_SETTINGS_PERMISSION_ID` is used by the DAO to update the settings of a multisig plugin, if the community approves
- `UPDATE_OPTIMISTIC_GOVERNANCE_SETTINGS_PERMISSION_ID` is used by the DAO to update the settings of the optimistic voting plugin, if the community approves

Other DAO specific permissions:

- `UPGRADE_DAO_PERMISSION`
- `SET_METADATA_PERMISSION`
- `SET_TRUSTED_FORWARDER_PERMISSION`
- `SET_SIGNATURE_VALIDATOR_PERMISSION`
- `REGISTER_STANDARD_CALLBACK_PERMISSION`

### Encoding and decoding actions

Making calls to the DAO is straightforward, however making execute arbitrary actions requires them to be encoded, stored on chain and be approved before they can be executed.

To this end, the DAO has a struct called `Action { to, value, data }`, which will make the DAO call the `to` address, with `value` ether and call the given calldata (if any). Such calldata is an ABI encoded array of bytes with the function to call and the parameters it needs. 

### DO's and DONT's

- Never grant `ROOT_PERMISSION` unless you are just trying things out
- Never uninstall all plugins, as this would brick your DAO
- Ensure that there is at least always one plugin with `EXECUTE_PERMISSION` on the DAO
- Ensure that the DAO is ROOT on itself
- Use the `_gap[]` variable for upgradeable plugins, as a way to reserve storage slots for future plugin implementations
  - Decrement the `_gap` number for every new variable (slot) you add in the future

### Plugin upgradeability

By default, only the DAO can upgrade plugins to newer versions. This requires passing a proposal.

```shell
$ forge build
```

### Test

```shell
$ forge test
```

### Formatting the code

## Deployment

### Deploying the DAO

1. Edit `script/multisig-members.json` with the list of addresses to set as signers
2. Run `forge build && forge test`
3. Copy `.env.example` into `.env` and define the settings
4. Run `source .env` to load them
5. Set the RPC URL and run the deployment script

```shell
RPC_URL="https://eth-holesky.g.alchemy.com/v2/${ALCHEMY_API_KEY}"
forge script --chain "$NETWORK" script/Deploy.s.sol:Deploy --rpc-url "$RPC_URL" --broadcast --verify
```

If you get the error `Failed to get EIP-1559 fees`, add `--legacy` to the last command:

```shell
forge script --chain "$NETWORK" script/Deploy.s.sol:Deploy --rpc-url "$RPC_URL" --broadcast --verify --legacy
```

If a some contracts fail to verify on Etherscan, retry with this command:

```shell
forge script --chain "$NETWORK" script/Deploy.s.sol:Deploy --rpc-url "$RPC_URL" --verify --legacy --private-key "$DEPLOYMENT_PRIVATE_KEY" --resume
```
